There are no comedones, papules, pustules, nodules, or cysts typical of acne. This appearance is more consistent with a non-acne dermatosis such as a depigmenting or inflammatory patch disorder."

The pattern and color are more consistent with a non-acne inflammatory or vascular dermatosis (e.g., rosacea or another dermatitis)."

This pattern is more consistent with a vascular inflammatory condition such as rosacea rather than acne vulgaris."

The pattern and background redness are more consistent with a rosacea-like or dermatitis process rather than acne vulgaris."

There is no surrounding inflammatory papules, pustules, nodules, or cysts that would suggest active acne lesions."

Their even pigmentation and lack of raised papules, pustules, nodules, or cysts are more consistent with a pigmented condition such as ephelides (freckles) or lentigines rather than any form of acne."

The skin surface appears even, without follicular-based lesions typical of acne. This pattern is more consistent with a pigmentary or inflammatory non-acne condition rather than true acneiform eruptions."

This pattern is more consistent with a pigmentary disorder (such as melasma or post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation) rather than an active acneiform eruption."

There are no comedones, papules, pustules, nodules, or cysts, and no inflammatory changes typical of acne lesions."

Their monomorphic appearance and distribution, especially around the nose and cheeks, are more consistent with a non-acne condition such as milia or another keratinization disorder rather than classic acne vulgaris."

Acne lesions arise from hair follicles and sebaceous glands in the skin, not from the conjunctiva or iris, and none of the characteristic acne morphologies are present."

The surface appears pebbly and thickened rather than inflamed, which is more consistent with a non-acne condition such as sebaceous hyperplasia or early phymatous change, rather than classic acneiform lesions."
