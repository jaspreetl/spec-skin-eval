# Skin Condition Classification Evaluation

A comparative evaluation framework for assessing AI models on dermatological image classification, focusing on acne detection and classification across different skin tones.

## Overview

This project evaluates three AI models (GPT-5.1, Claude Sonnet 4, and MedGemma) on a balanced dataset of 300 skin condition images. The framework provides standardized evaluation metrics and automated reporting for fair model comparison.
